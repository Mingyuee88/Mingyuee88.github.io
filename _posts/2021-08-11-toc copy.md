# Demo: Reproducing OpenAI's GPT-2
GPT-2 is an important achievement released by OpenAI in 2019, demonstrating significant progress in the field of natural language processing. Its fundamental paper, "Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners", expounds on many key ideas. 

GPT-2 adopts the Transformer neural network architecture, has 1.6 billion parameters, a maximum context length of 1024 tokens, and has been trained on approximately 100 billion tokens. If students want to deeply understand how to use llm.c to reproduce GPT-2, they can visit this discussion link: [Let's Reproduce GPT-2](#). By actually operating to reproduce the model, we can have a deeper understanding of the working principle and inference process of the model.

# "Base" Models in Practice

## Examples of Base Models
In practical applications, there are many well-known base models. For example, OpenAI's GPT-2 has 1.6 billion parameters and has been trained on 100 billion tokens. There is also Meta's Llama 3, which has 405 billion parameters and has been trained on 15 trillion tokens. You can learn more detailed information about Llama 3 through this paper: [Llama 3 paper from Meta](#). These base models are like powerful knowledge treasure troves, providing fundamental support for various specific applications.

## Content of Model Release
When a machine learning model is released or shared, several key components are provided. 
**1. Code**: For example, the code required to run the Transformer model is about 200 lines in Python. These codes define the structure, running logic, etc. of the model.
**2. Model Parameters**: For example, the 1.6 billion parameter values of GPT-2. These parameters are the embodiment of the knowledge learned by the model during the training process, and they determine the way the model processes input data and the output result.

# Analysis of the Characteristics of Base Models
From a psychological perspective, a base model can be regarded as a token-level internet document simulator. It is stochastic and probabilistic, which means that each time it is run, due to its internal probability calculation mechanism, different results may be obtained. 

It is like "dreaming" of internet documents and can generate seemingly reasonable text content. However, sometimes it may also recite the original text of the training documents verbatim, that is, the situation of "memory reproduction" occurs. 

The parameters of the model are like a lossy zip file of the internet. Although some details are lost during the compression process, a large amount of useful knowledge is still stored in the network parameters. Currently, through clever design of prompts, we can already use base models to achieve some applications. For example, constructing an English-Korean translator by utilizing "few-shot" prompts and leveraging the "in-context learning" ability of the model; and creating an assistant that can answer questions by designing prompts similar to conversations.

However, we can explore more and better application methods, which requires you to keep learning and researching.
