# About This Site

This educational website is dedicated to exploring the fascinating world of Large Language Models (LLMs), from their foundational training to advanced applications. Created as part of a course taught by Dr. Yong Jin at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, this site serves as both a learning resource and a demonstration of web development using Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

## Course Information

This website was developed primarily for Master's and PhD students in Finance to expand their foundational knowledge about Large Language Models (LLMs). The course aims to provide finance students with an understanding of advanced technology, specifically illustrating the relevance between LLMs and finance. Students will learn how technology can be applied to financial contexts and how large language models can make financial analysis more accessible and efficient. By bridging the gap between technological innovation and financial applications, this course prepares future finance professionals to leverage cutting-edge tools in their practice and research.
