Welcome to our LLM self-study site!
Here, we will focus on two main stages of learning about Large Language Models (LLMs): pre-training and post-training. By understanding these two phases in depth, you will gain a comprehensive grasp of the construction and optimization processes of LLMs. The pre-training phase emphasizes using vast amounts of data to initially train the model, enabling it to capture the fundamental patterns and structures of language, while the post-training phase employs various optimization techniques to enhance the model's performance and adaptability.

## Mind Mapping
To aid your understanding of these two stages, we provide a mind map that outlines the key steps and related techniques for each phase. This mind map will serve as a clear framework for your learning, helping you systematically grasp the core concepts and applications of LLMs.

In the following study, we will gradually explore the various building stages of LLM to help you fully understand the principles and applications of this cutting-edge technology.
